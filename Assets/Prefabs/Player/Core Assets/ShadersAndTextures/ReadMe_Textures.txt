Hi there

Once again, thanks for the purchase. 

Brief notes about the textures. 

Ive included some Bmps of some tattoo variants, feel free to try them but dropping them into the albedo and specular channels of the shader. 


Also, ive decided to include the psds. These are simply setup texture files. The colours are made using masks and colour fills. If you have Photoshop, feel free to open these and change the characters textures as youd like

As always, would love to see what you do with her
