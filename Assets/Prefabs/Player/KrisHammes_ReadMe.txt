Hello Customer! 

Firstly a massive thankyou for your purchase, I can only create this content with your support its greatly appreciated. 


I hope you enjoy your purchase, with some luck with character will be the first of a set (i want to make a voodoo woman at the very least!) 


I'm considering this to be a model only download, however I have included a very simple controller and some animations so you can have a quick look at the character.

I want you the user to be able to make her your own, to this end ive included source files (pds and maya files) if you create any custom constent for her I'd love to see it. 

So, whether showing me something cool, asking for support or even just to say Hi, you can contact me

Once again thankyou, and if you like this character kindly consider the others on my store.
